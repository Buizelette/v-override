# v-override
ABOUT:
This is a continuation of Konjimma's storyline remover mod, originally called GTA V Override. It was hosted on 5Mods along with all his other mods before he mysteriously disappeared along with all his work, and he hasn't been seen since.

So... I dug around and found his old code, and after learning a bit of how to use VS and some more additions to my coding knowledge, I decided to recontinue it.

GUIDELINES:
This is hosted under the ownership of Buizelette / SylveticHearts, and has been owned by me since it was transferred to my name after Konjimma's abandonment of the mod and disappearance around two or three years ago from the time of writing this. 
 
You may modify the mod for personal use. 
You may host this on other GTA related modding sites that are deemed safe ONLY if I allowed you to do so formally.
You may use the mod and it's functionality, like any player would.

You may NOT host this anywhere except for 5Mods without prior permission.
You may not make profit such as locking it behind a Patreon, or use URL shorteners if hosting it externally.
You may not claim this mod as your own.
